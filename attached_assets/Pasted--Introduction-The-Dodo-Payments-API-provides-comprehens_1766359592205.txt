## API Key Management and Authentication

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access API Keys">
    Navigate to **Developer → API Keys** in your dashboard to manage your keys.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate a New Key">
    Select **Add API Key**, provide a descriptive name, and configure write access:

    * **Enable write access** (checked): Full read and write permissions for all API operations
    * **Enable write access** (unchecked): Read-only access - can only fetch data (payments, subscriptions, customers, products). Cannot create or modify resources.

    <Tip>
      Uncheck "Enable write access" for dashboard integrations, analytics tools, and any system that only needs to view data without making changes.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Store Your Key Securely">
    Copy the generated key immediately and ensure it is stored securely.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authenticate Your API Requests">
    Use your API keys to authenticate all requests. Apply the following authorization format:

    ```bash  theme={null}
    Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
    ```

    <Warning>
      Never expose your secret API keys in client-side code or public repositories.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>
