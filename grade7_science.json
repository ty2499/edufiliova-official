            "content": "All living things are made up of cells, which are the basic structural and functional units of life. Cells contain specialized structures called organelles that work together to carry out essential life processes. Plant and animal cells share many common features but also have distinct differences in their structure and organization. Understanding cell structure is fundamental to biology as it helps explain how organisms grow, reproduce, and maintain homeostasis.",

            "title": "Photosynthesis",
            "content": "Photosynthesis is a vital biological process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy stored in glucose molecules. During this process, plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and water from their roots, using chlorophyll in chloroplasts to capture sunlight. The process produces glucose (sugar) for the plant's energy needs and releases oxygen as a byproduct, which is essential for most life on Earth. Photosynthesis consists of two main stages: light-dependent reactions and light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle).",

            "content": "Matter exists in several states, with the three most common being solid, liquid, and gas. A fourth state, plasma, exists at extremely high temperatures. The state of matter depends on the kinetic energy of particles (how fast they move) and the strength of intermolecular forces between them. In solids, particles are tightly packed and vibrate in fixed positions. In liquids, particles are close together but can move past each other. In gases, particles are far apart and move freely in all directions. Temperature and pressure changes can cause matter to transition between states through processes like melting, freezing, evaporation, condensation, sublimation, and deposition.",

Weather is influenced by factors such as air pressure, temperature, humidity, wind patterns, and precipitation.

Physical changes include melting, freezing, cutting, and dissolving, and are usually reversible.
