            "title": "Understanding Maps and Globes",
            "content": "Maps and globes are important tools for understanding our world. A map is a flat representation of Earth's surface, while a globe is a three-dimensional model. Both use symbols, colors, and labels to show geographic features like continents, countries, cities, mountains, and rivers.",

              {"problem": "Why might you use a globe instead of a flat map?", "solution": ["Step 1: Globes show true shapes and sizes of continents", "Step 2: Flat maps distort areas, especially near the poles", "Step 3: Globes help understand distance and direction better"]}

            "content": "Climate and weather are related but different concepts. Weather is the day-to-day conditions in a specific place, while climate is the average weather patterns over many years. Climate is affected by factors like latitude, elevation, distance from water, and landforms.",

              {"problem": "Explain why mountaintop temperatures are cooler than valley temperatures", "solution": ["Step 1: Temperature decreases with elevation", "Step 2: Air becomes thinner at higher altitudes", "Step 3: Mountains receive less direct sunlight and lose heat quickly"]}

            "content": "Ancient civilizations developed around rivers because water provided irrigation for farming, transportation for trade, and fresh water for drinking.
